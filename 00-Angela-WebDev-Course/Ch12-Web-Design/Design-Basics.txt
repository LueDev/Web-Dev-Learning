2. Typography: Sans Serif 
3. Principles of UI:
    1. Hierarchy through size of elements.
    2. Layout of elements to add emphasis to call to action and main messages
    3. Alignment of elements in sections to represent cohesive design.
    4. White space to present products/information cleaner/minimalist (ex: luxury handbags) 
    5. Audience: cater the website to the audience who you intend to reach.
4. Principles of UX: 
    1. Simplicity of the site
    2. Consistency of layouts, styles, fonts, and alignments
    3. Reading patterns: F and Z patterns predominantly
    4. Cross-Platform design: Design for watch, mobile, laptop, desktop, tv, and wider screens in mind depending on the nature of the site.
5. Dark Patterns: Using Reading/Style/Text that would only benefit the company, not the user. Mainly, this will add sneaky/hard-to-read terms that benefit the company.
                  This practice is typically frowned upon and leads to very little user retention.
