The order in which CSS is written in matters such that the one that comes last will overwrite the previous.


CSS Specificity: When adding multiple styles to the same elements, the most specific css selection will triumph. 
                 Remember the following order: ID > Class > Element. ID is king when choosing css selectors.

    ex: post button hovers turns it blue (button.post:hover{color:blue}) 
        and post button active turns it gold (button.post:active{color:gold}), 
        this 'might' conflict bc they're both the same level of specific. 

    For more check out a Specificity calculator. 

Inline styles (styles added to html files within the element declaration) have even higher priority than IDs and should 
    generally be avoided as it may lead to confusion.

!important: 
    The "!important" css attribute is the exception to specificity and will take absolute priority over anything else 
    in the stylesheet.

        Warning: This should not be used in plugins/mashups/site-wide css
